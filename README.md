# SIAP (Sistem Informasi Pengaduan Warga pada Desa Situdam)

SIAP is an application designed to facilitate residents in providing aspirations and complaints to the local government, specifically the village officials. The purpose of creating this system is not only to serve the residents of the village, but also to fulfill the graduation requirements for my education program as a creator at the Associate Degree level in preparing the thesis. This system is built with CodeIgniter version 3 and requires a minimum of PHP version 5. Therefore, if there are any errors or bugs encountered during installation or usage, it may be due to an unsupported PHP version.
